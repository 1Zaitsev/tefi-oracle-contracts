# Oracle Hub

The Oracle Hub keeps track of available sources for symbols. Additionally it keeps a map of token addresses to symbol, so that it is possible to query prices by token address.

The Oracle Hub owner manages the whitelist of proxies and has the authority to register a proxy to a given symbol, as well as modify price source priorities.
